# 00 – Welcome to AI Hacking

> You’re about to break your first AI.

This isn’t a textbook.  
This is a hands-on, prompt-by-prompt hacking guide for exploring the inner workings of chatbots, large language models (LLMs), and AI systems.

You don’t need to be a developer.  
You don’t need to know machine learning.  
You don’t even need to know what “prompt injection” means yet.

All you need is a chat window and curiosity.

## 🧠 What Is AI Hacking?

“AI Hacking” means using language to make an AI **say, do, or reveal things it wasn’t supposed to.**

You’ll learn how to:

- Bypass restrictions
- Trick the AI into revealing secrets
- Inject hidden commands into conversations
- Understand how red teamers test and attack AI systems

Sometimes it’ll feel like you’re social engineering a machine.  
Other times, it’s more like breaking a puzzle with words.

## 🛡️ A Quick Word on Ethics

You’re here to **learn**, not cause harm.  
We’re not exploiting real systems or targeting live apps we don’t own.  
This book is about **awareness, defense, and education**.

You’ll learn how attackers think—so you can become one of the good ones.

> If you ever wonder, “Should I do this to a real chatbot?”  
> The answer is simple: **Not unless you have permission.**

This project is for **educational and ethical hacking purposes only**.  
Do **not** use these techniques on real systems without permission.  
Please read the [full disclaimer here](../DISCLAIMER.md).
